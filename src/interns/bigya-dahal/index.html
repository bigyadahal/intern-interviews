      <p> I am Bigya Dahal from Troy, Michigan. I am purshuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Oakland Univerity, Rochester, Michigan. I am done with all my coursework and looking 
	  for an intership to finish my degree. I have done several course projects as follows: </p>
	  <b>DCAA Compliant Time Management : Sep 2020 – Dec 2020 </b><br>
- Designed and developed Projects Time Management Application using MongoDB, Meteor, JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Senior Capstone Project. The project supports new business registration, user and project administration, timesheet management, approval management.

<br><b> Uchat : Jan 2020 – Apr 2020 </b><br>

- Created a Chat Application using Node.js, HTML and CSS. The project supports login credentials, chat rooms and group chat.

<br><b>Budget Application : Sep 2019 – Dec 2019 </b><br>

- Developed Budget Application using Java and JavaFX as part for Sophomore Project to track income, living expenses and saving goals along with login credentials and report generation.
  <p> I am interested in Application development which was the main reasons I worked on the above projects. I want to get into Software Engineering for two main reasons. 1) Software is everwhere thesedays
from Finance, Education, Automotive, Commmunication, HealthCare and many more. Its a growing field and I see tremendouse opportunities working in this field. 2) Women workforce is relatively far less
in Technology field as well as in STEM field altogether. As a woman, I want to have some contribution in this field and also want to be part of a drive to motivate other womean to gain STEM education and work 
in Tech. The internship opportunity availale at Lob directly matches my interest. Hence I am applying for the intership position.
 </p>
 <p> Thank you and looking forward to hearning from you!</p>
